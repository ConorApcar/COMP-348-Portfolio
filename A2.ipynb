Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.\",\n",

    "the non 5 star reviews that were mislabelled seem to suffer from a different problem. At first glance looking through some of these reviews, all of them are really short. There simply isn't enough data in the review to get a good idea of whether it's a 5 star review or not. The reviews either seem to be obviously negative when you read them, but the classifier can't determine that with the amount of data it's given. Otherwise, these short reviews seem to be filled with positive reviews, making it seem super positive and giving the impression that it is a 5 star review. \n",
