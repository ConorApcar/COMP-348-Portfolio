    "In this assignment you will practice with the use of Python packages for text processing as a first step towards implementing real-world document processing systems.\n",

    "The deadline of this assignment is before census date, so it can serve as a diagnostic test so that you can determine if you want to remain in the unit or withdraw without penalty.\n",

    "Below are the questions of this assignment. They are in the format of a Jupyter notebook so that you can use this notebook to work on your solution. Write the final solution in a standalone Python file as described in the \"submission\" section by the end of these assignment specifications.\n"

    "Implement a function that returns a vector of word counts in a given text, given a vector of words. For your solution you may use third-party modules if you wish. As part of this exercise you will need to split the text into words. When you do it, please note that NLTK's tokeniser works best when it takes sentences as their input. Thus, to tokenise a text that has multiple sentences it is best first to split the text into sentences, and then tokenise each sentence. Look at the lecture notes and exercises of the week 1 workshop for examples of how to do this."
